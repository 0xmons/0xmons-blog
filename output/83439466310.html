<div class="content"><p>Soon you&#8217;ll be able to run your own NFT lotteries, powered by ChainLink. I&#8217;m really excited for this because it leverages blockchain in all the relevant ways: it&#8217;s the distribution of a digital asset in a trustless manner, with all conditions clear for everyone to see.</p>

<p>NFT-Lottery is launching soon on testnet, and then mainnet soon after. Thus, I thought I&#8217;d write a little bit about how v0 will work, and what will be live at launch.</p>

<p>To start, NFT-Lottery is completely permission0less. Anyone will be able to create a lottery for any ERC721 that they own for any price. An NFT lottery is basically a ticket sale (in v0, tickets are sold in ETH) where a random ticket holder then gets a specified NFT at the end of the duration. NFT-Lottery uses ChainLink&#8217;s VRF to select a random ticket holder.</p>

<p>To improve the experience for both buyers and lottery creators, NFT-Lottery has several cool features:</p>

<p>First, the NFT is escrowed into the lottery contract during creation, so buyers know the NFT will be guaranteed there to be distributed at the end of the lottery.</p>

<p>Secondly, lottery creators have to specify a minimum number and maximum number of tickets to sell. If the minimum number isn&#8217;t reached by the end of the lottery, buyers can burn their tickets to get their ETH back. As a corollary, the lottery creator can&#8217;t claim their ETH until the NFT has been distributed.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the tickets themselves are NFTs with on-chain metadata/image that track the progress of the lottery. Users can get a rough idea of how the lottery is progressing, even from platforms like OpenSea.</p>

<p>Fourthly, <em>lottery creators keep all ETH from their ticket sales</em>. The NFT-Lottery platform only takes a flat fee during lottery creation.</p>

<p>The code is up on GitHub, has been robustly unit-tested, and peer reviewed. The next steps are building out a UI for testnet, and then an alpha mainnet launch afterwards. If you&#8217;d like to create a lottery for your own ERC721s, let me know on Twitter!</p>
